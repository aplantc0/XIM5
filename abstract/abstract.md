**Key message:** Do both individual tracheids and total tree-ring widths provide the same information on how far Scots pine can withstand drought?

As drought-tolerant tree species, *Pinus sylvestris* L. (Scots pine) in Central Europe yet expresses drought-induced secondary growth variability, reflected in cellular and tissue level changes in xylem anatomy.
Here, we investigate to what extent Scots pine trees can withstand water deficit stress, and what level of observation better allows to identify it.
To study Scots pine xylem formation, 3 research plots (150-350 m asl), representing managed Scots pine stands aged 40-100 years, were selected in the south of the Czech Republic.
At each plot, weekly microcore sampling was performed on 6 dominant trees during the growing seasons 2020 and 2021, whereas macrocores were taken from another 12 dominant trees at the end of the study.
To relate xylem morphology to climatic variables intra- and inter-annually, we analyzed:
i) current timing of tracheid development;
ii) morphological metrics of fully formed annual rings, such as tracheid radial diameter, secondary cell wall thickness, and number of tracheids;
iii) tree-ring width time series for the whole tree lifespan.
Our work aims to identify the numerical thresholds in number, radial dimensions of tracheids and tree-ring widths, up to which these variables can decline without tree dieback.
We hypothesize that the same mechanism of drought stress reaction in Scots pine is revealed regardless of tree age, though the information kept by cells and tissues might be different.
